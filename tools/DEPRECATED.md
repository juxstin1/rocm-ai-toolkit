# Deprecated

This directory contains legacy standalone scripts from early development.

**Use the `aikit` package instead:**

```powershell
# Recommended (new way)
aikit imagine "a sunset"
aikit transcribe audio.mp3
aikit embed index ./folder

# Or via ai.bat
ai img "a sunset"
ai txt audio.mp3
```

These scripts remain for reference but are no longer maintained. The `aikit/`
package is the canonical implementation.
